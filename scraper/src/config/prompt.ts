CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES:
1. Output MUST be in CSV format: title,description,url,sourceName,author
2. Output MUST ONLY include articles that exist in the input content
3. If no relevant articles found, output empty string ("")
4. No commentary, markdown, or additional formatting
5. No example or generated content

IMPORTANT: DO NOT create articles. DO NOT generate URLs. ONLY extract existing content.

Remember: Empty string is the correct output when no articles are found.

You will output a JSON object containing categorized news articles. Each category MUST contain exactly 5-30 articles, organized by relevance.

Article Selection Priority System:
1. PRIORITY 1 - Direct Match (Score: 90-100)
   - Articles that perfectly align with Elata's mission
   - Research directly related to neuroscience, depression, anxiety
   - Clear industry developments in relevant biotech

2. PRIORITY 2 - Strong Connection (Score: 70-89)
   - Articles from adjacent fields with clear applications
   - Technology developments with direct mental health implications
   - Related biotech industry news

3. PRIORITY 3 - Strategic Relevance (Score: 50-69)
   - Broader developments that could impact the field
   - Emerging technologies with potential applications
   - Industry trends that could affect Elata's mission

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:
- Each category MUST have at least 5 articles
- Each category may have a maximum of 10 articles
- Start with Priority 1 articles
- If fewer than 5 Priority 1 articles exist, add Priority 2 articles
- If still under 5, add Priority 3 articles
- For Priority 2-3 articles, explicitly state the strategic relevance in the description

FORMAT RULES:
- Use empty string ("") for unknown fields
- Ensure all URLs are valid
- Keep descriptions concise but informative (50-200 characters)
- Include source attribution in 'name' field
- DO NOT HALLUCINATE
- DO NOT MAKE UP ARTICLES
- DO NOT INCLUDE ANY TEXT BEFORE OR AFTER THE JSON OBJECT
- DO NOT WRAP THE JSON IN QUOTES OR ADDITIONAL FORMATTING

${ELATA_MISSION_ROLE_PROMPT}
Task:

You will receive a CSV list of articles from the past 24 hours. These articles are obtained form NewsAPI, as well as form scrapping the web.

Your job is to:
- Analyze all articles in the CSV data.
- Create a json object to power a dashboard to help Elata stay updated with the latest news in neuroscience and biotechnology.
- Avoid repetition by summarizing similar articles together if they cover the same topic.
- Exclude articles that are not relevant to Elata's mission.
- Provide concise and informative summaries.

${ELATA_NEWS_CATEGORIES_PROMPT}

${ELATA_SUMMARY_OUTPUT_FORMAT_DESCRIPTION}

${ELATA_SUMMARY_OUTPUT_FORMAT_JSON}

Instructions:
- Output MUST be a valid JSON object, not a string
- Do not include any text before or after the JSON object
- Do not wrap the JSON in quotes or additional formatting
- Each category MUST contain an array of AT LEAST 5 article objects - this is a strict requirement
- Each article object must have: title, description, url, name (source name), and author fields
- Never output empty categories
- For research and industry categories, aim for 10-30 articles when relevant content is available
- When including tangentially related articles to meet the minimum requirement, clearly explain the relevance in the description
- The output will be written directly to a JSON file, so it must be valid JSON
- If you cannot find 5 directly relevant articles for a category, you MUST include tangentially related articles to reach the minimum of 5

IMPORTANT: Having fewer than 5 articles in any category is considered a failure. Always meet this minimum requirement while maintaining reasonable relevance to Elata's mission.

${ELATA_SUMMARY_OUTPUT_FORMAT_JSON}

The CSV data is provided below:

export const MAIN_PROMPT_INSTRUCTIONS = `
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
{
  "research": [{ article1 }, { article2 }, ...], // Minimum 5, aim for 10-30
  "industry": [{ article1 }, { article2 }, ...], // Minimum 5, aim for 10-30
  "biohacking": [{ article1 }, { article2 }, ...], // Minimum 5
  "computational": [{ article1 }, { article2 }, ...], // Minimum 5
  "hardware": [{ article1 }, { article2 }, ...], // Minimum 5
  "desci": [{ article1 }, { article2 }, ...], // Minimum 5
  "offTopic": [{ article1 }, { article2 }, ...] // Minimum 5 aim for 10-30
}

CRITICAL VALIDATION STEPS:
1. ✓ Verify each category has >= 5 articles
2. ✓ Confirm all articles have required fields
3. ✓ Check relevance scores match priority system
4. ✓ Ensure descriptions explain relevance for Priority 2-3 articles
5. ✓ Validate JSON structure before output

ERROR PREVENTION:
- If category lacks Priority 1 articles, DO NOT leave empty
- If article count < 5, MUST expand to lower priority articles
- If field unknown, use "" (never null or undefined)
- Never skip categories or output malformed JSON

Remember: Outputting fewer than 5 articles per category is a CRITICAL FAILURE.

CATEGORY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

Hardware Category (MINIMUM 5 ARTICLES):
- If direct hardware news is limited, include:
  * General medical device innovations
  * Sensor technology developments
  * Research equipment advances
  * Consumer health devices
  * Computing hardware relevant to neuroscience

Off Topic Category (MINIMUM 5 ARTICLES):
- If struggling to fill, consider:
  * General AI/ML developments
  * Data science innovations
  * Research methodology advances
  * Scientific computing news
  * Open science initiatives
  * Always explain relevance to Elata in description

CRITICAL: These categories MUST NOT be empty or have fewer than 5 articles. Expand scope while maintaining reasonable connection to Elata's mission.
